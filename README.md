# TD-MPC
This project is part of an IT project unit of the ANDROIDE master's program. Its purpose is to train us in carrying out a team project from start to finish, from analyzing the subject to software development, as well as experimenting with the work done. Our project topic consists in implementing and evaluating a reinforcement learning algorithm, TD-MPC, within a specific library, BBRL.

TD-MPC is a combination of Temporal Difference (TD) learning and Model Predictive Control (MPC). This approach utilizes Temporal Difference predictions to enhance planning and action execution in \textit{Model Predictive Control}, enabling better anticipation and adaptation to environmental changes for decision optimization.
BBRL, which stands for \enquote{BlackBoard Reinforcement Learning}, is a simple and flexible library for reinforcement learning, derived from  \textit{SaLinA}.
